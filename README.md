# Tox_data

Here is some data for toxicology students to develop models. Having them stored on github in this way is very convenient. There are loads of well developed data sources out there and this repo is just for tutorials etc.

If you are looking for lots of toxicological and pharmacological data for modelling...
A great source of data for pharmacology and toxicology computational experiments is called the [therapeutic data commons](https://tdcommons.ai)
This databse includes many of the well known datasets such as Xu for Ames and several for ADME and tox.

Dataset "herg_mfp.csv" from Konda with molecules coded as Morgan FPs radius 2, 1024 bits and herg=1 if pIC50 is greater or equal to 6.
